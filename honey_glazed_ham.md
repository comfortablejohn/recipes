## Ingredients 
+ 100g (1/2 cup) brown sugar
+ 80ml (1/3 cup) maple syrup
+ 1tbsp Dijon mustard
+ 1 Ham (duh)
## Method
1. Stir the sugar, maple syrup, honey and mustard in a bowl until the sugar dissolves. 
2. Preheat oven to 170C. Line a large baking dish with 2 layers of non-stick baking paper. Place an oven shelf in the lowest position. Remove all other shelves. Use a sharp knife to cut around the shank of the ham, about 10cm from the end. Run a knife under the rind around edge of ham. Gently lift the rind off in 1 piece by running your fingers between the rind and the fat. Score the fat in a diamond pattern, about 5mm deep. Stud the centres of the diamonds with cloves. Transfer to prepared dish. 
3. Brush one-third of the glaze over the ham. Bake, brushing with glaze every 25 minutes, for 1 hour 30 minutes.
